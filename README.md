# SimpleMemoryAllocator v0.1.1

A simple custom memory allocator in C++. A small personal project of mine, striving mainly for simplicity of use and user feature completeness.
It's a project on which wish to learn practical skills, improve upon it and eventually use it in future projects.

This library is licenced under the MIT Licence.

### FUTURE PLANS (sorted by descending priority)
  - allow for allocating and deallocating arrays
  - implement an assert/error system
  - add examples and benchmarks
  - make the MSVC solution for potential Windows users
  - extend the Makefile to create a dynamic library as well
  - implement more allocators
  - new features? time will tell...
  

### CHANGELOG
v0.1 
  - initial GitHub commit as SimpleMemoryManager!
  
v0.1.1 
  - rebranded to SimpleMemoryAllocator to better reflect its funcionality
  - added this readme and changelog
  - changed licence to MIT
  - removed MSVC solution and project, will be readded once it works
